# API documentation

Welcome to Flame's API docs! Select a namespace or type on the left to get a detailed description of its API.

If you're new to Flame and/or just browsing the docs, then the [Flame](Flame) and [Flame.Compiler](Flame.Compiler) namespaces are probably a good place to start: they introduce most of Flame's core concepts, ranging from its type system to its SSA IR.
